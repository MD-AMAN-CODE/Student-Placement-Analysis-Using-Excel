📝 Project Description (LinkedIn Post ke liye)

I analyzed a real-world student placement dataset (5,000+ records) using Microsoft Excel to understand the key academic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors that influence placement outcomes.

The project focuses on identifying patterns related to CGPA, study hours, sleep duration, attendance, backlogs, projects completed, stress level, and extracurricular involvement.

Through data cleaning, KPI creation, and visualization, this project provides actionable insights that can help students and institutions improve placement performance.
